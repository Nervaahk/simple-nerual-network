# simple-neural-network
A neural network built from scratch in Numpy to learn fundamentals such as backprogagation. The goal is to learn a target through sigmoid activation and manual backprogagtion. This project helped me understand the math behind neural networks such as backprogation and weight updates and criterion and so on.

Skills used: 

Python  

Numpy  



How to Run:
1. Clone the Repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Nervaahk/simple-neural-network.git
   
   cd simple-neural-network
   

3. Create Virtual Env:
   python -m venv venv
   
   source venv/bin/activate (if on Linux)
   
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat (if on Windows)
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
5. Run the Network

   python neural.py
