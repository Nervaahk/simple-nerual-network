# simple-nerual-network
A nerual network built from scratch in Numpy to learn fundamentals such as backprogagation.

Skills used:
Python
Numpy

Learned:
How neural networks work and how functions such as sigmoid and its derivative allow the network to adjust weights and biases.

How to Run:
1. Clone the Repository:
   git https://github.com/Nervaahk/simple-neural-network.git
   cd simple-neural-network

2. Create Virtual Env:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate (if on Linux)
   venv\Scripts\activate.bat (if on Windows)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Network
   python neural.py
